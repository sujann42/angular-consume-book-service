1) Create a service and create a list called book and an object of HttpClient inside the constructor.
  books: any;
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
2) create a method inside the service and call the rest api with that service
getBooks() {
    return this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/findAllBooks');
  }
3) go to the component that consumes that rest api and import Service on that component and call the method
import {BookService} from '../book.service';

4) On the component, create an object of the Service
constructor(private bookService: BookService) { }

4) Using the object of the service call the method which is in the service.
5) Set the response to an object for the visualization purpose.
ngOnInit() {
    const response = this.bookService.getBooks();
    response.subscribe((data) => this.books = data);
  }
